# Final Project Plan
## Elevator Pitch
Becoming more environmentally conscious is a daunting task for many. Although extreme lifestyle transformations such as going zero waste or cultivating a sustainable farm are incredible goals to strive for, such drastic changes are often unsustainable and not as effective as small practices one can implement into their daily life. The Green Guide is a platform that aides users in their journies to living more sustainable lives and advocating for the climate. The Green Guide is aimed at individuals who care about the environment and climate change but may not know how to take action. In addition to its many resources on sustainability and political action, the app also provides a tracker to helps users with accountability and planning. The overall ambition of the app is to make environmentalism accessible and straightforward for all users.
